# Super Mario Bros 3

Recreation of Super Mario Bros 3 with Pygame for fun

## Utilisation

Have Numpy and Pygame installed

Execute main.py at the root of the project

## Description

This project is based on the course "Premier projet d'informatique" of Laurent Mathy (https://people.montefiore.uliege.be/mathy/ppi/) and "Laboratoires de programmation mathématique et physique" of Bernard Boigelot (https://people.montefiore.uliege.be/boigelot/cours/labmp/index.html) for 1st bachelier in Computer Sciences at University of Liège. Technologies used (Pygame) and restrictions (no structures or classes) are the same than in the course (I still allow myself to use Numpy).

Note: I followed every labo but only the 1st half of PPI before starting this project.

## Progress
